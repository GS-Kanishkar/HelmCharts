#Without Helm

I was trying to deploy the nginx image for dev , qa and prod

for dev i was trying 1 replicas
for QA  i was trying 2 replicas
for Prod i was trying 3 replicas

I had 3 folders and inside all i have 3 deploy and 3 service yaml files
If i want to update anything then i have to update all the files and apply these files again
